# Emma Ashley
Hey! 

Thanks for taking the time to get to know more about me. 


A little about me... I’m a full stack software developer with a background connecting with entrepreneurs and helping their businesses grow.  I am a creative problem solver, can think on my feet and am a keen learner.  I’m a big fan of fast paced growth environments that allow me to help solve problems, spot new opportunities and enable others to succeed.  Adding value and making a positive impact has always been an important part of the work that I do and will continue to be as I embark on my new adventure in tech.
